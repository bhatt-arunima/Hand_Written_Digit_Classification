# Hand_Written_Digit_Classification

# Dataset Description

The MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification Dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits.
Each image is 28 pixels in height and 28 pixels in width, for a total of 784 pixels in total. Each pixel has a single pixel-value associated with it, indicating the lightness or darkness of that pixel, with higher numbers meaning darker. This pixel-value is an integer between 0 and 255, inclusive.

# Objective

The goal of this Project is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of thousands of handwritten images using Tensorflow 2.x. 

# Tasks Performed

-Prepared the dataset for the model

-Developed Single Layer Perceptron model for classifying the handwritten digits

-Plotted the change in accuracy per epochs

-Evaluated the model on the testing data

-Analysed the model summary

-Added hidden layer to the model to make it Multi-Layer Perceptron

-Added Dropout Layer to prevent overfitting and checked its effect on accuracy

-Increased the number of Hidden Layer neuron and checked its effect on accuracy

-Used different optimizers and checked its effect on accuracy

-Increased the hidden layers and checked its effect on accuracy

-Manipulated the batch_size and epochs and checked its effect on accuracy
